            <h1 font-weight:bold;">Planned Giving</h1>
            <p>Planned Giving is a  great way to simultaneously support The American Spectator Foundation's mission while optimizing the value of your assets and minimizing your tax burden.</p>
                                  <br></br>
           <h2 style="text-decoration: underline;">Charitable Gifts through Retirement Funds</h2>
            <h3>Qualified Charitable Distribution (QCD) or IRA Charitable Rollover</h3>
              <p>Suppose you anticipate that you will not need all of your retirement funds for living expenses. In that case, if you are over the age of 70 ½, and you have a regular IRA, you can instruct your IRA administrator to transfer up to $100,000 each year to charity. These transfers are not included in your taxable income, and they count towards your mandatory distributions- which, as noted, currently begin at the age of 72.</p>

            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Charitable Remainder Trusts</h3>
              <p>You may make a donation to The American Spectator Foundation via a charitable remainder trust.</p>
              <p>A charitable remainder trust (CRT) enables a donor to transfer property, cash, or other assets into an irrevocable trust and to stipulate the distribution of the trust income and principal. A charitable remainder trust may be set up as either a charitable unitrust (CRUT) or a charitable annuity trust (CRAT). A CRUT pays out a fixed percentage of the trust’s value, as determined on an annual basis. A CRAT pays out a fixed percentage of the trust’s initial value each year. The trust may become effective during the donor’s lifetime or at death contingent upon his preference.</p>
              <p>The benefit of a charitable remainder trust is that the donor receives a tax deduction for the present value of the charitable remainder interest. If the trust includes the transfer of real property, the donor will also avoid capital gains tax.</p>

            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Estate Gifts under a Will or Living Trust</h3>
              <p>You may designate The American Spectator Foundation as a beneficiary in your will or living trust. If the donation is set up as an annuity trust or a unitrust, your estate is permitted an estate-tax deduction for a portion of the initial value of the trust.</p>

            <h3 style="text-decoration: underline;">Planned Gifts of Life Insurance</h3>
              <p>You may also designate The American Spectator Foundation as a beneficiary of a life insurance policy.</p>
