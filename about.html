              <h3>The American Spectator</h3>
              <p>The American Spectator Foundation is a D.C.-based non-profit organization that is responsible for publishing The American Spectator and its daily companion website to provide Americans and decision makers in and outside of government with news and commentary on politics, economics, and culture from a conservative perspective.</p>
              <p>Founded in 1967, The American Spectator has been bringing quality journalism to the forefront of the national political conversation. Throughout the years, its writers have included renowned scholars and thought leaders such as Thomas Sowell, Tom Wolfe, P.J. O'Rourke, George F. Will, Patrick J. Buchanan, Malcolm Muggeridge, and its founder, R. Emmett Tyrrell, Jr. Each month its writings reach tens of thousands of readers.
</p>
              <p>Through its publication, The American Spectator Foundation seeks to educate the public on new ideas and policies that favor traditional American values, such as economic freedom, individual liberty, self-sufficiency, and limited government. To this end, the Foundation also trains and cultivates young writers for careers in journalism and serves as an outlet for a host of both young and established conservative writers and thinkers.If you are interested in interning at The American Spectator through the Young Writers Program, please contact <a href="mailto:cravottal@spectator.org">cravottal@spectator.org</a>.</p>

              <p class="pull-quote">“Interning at The American Spectator gave me the opportunity to hone my writing skills by working hands-on with top-notch editors at a respected publication. By the end of my summer at TAS, I had become a more thoughtful writer and careful editor, all while working with a great team of people.” <br><br> - Bradley Evans, 2018</p>
